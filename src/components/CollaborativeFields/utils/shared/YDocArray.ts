 * DocArrays are stored in a yjs shared array. The value

 * of the object contents.*
 *
 * DocArray children are fields that may create their own
 * shared type. These are always prefixed with
 * `__docArray.KEY.`, where `KEY` is the key of the doc array.
 * These need to be deleted when we are setting the doc array
 * so there are no leftover usused shared types.

 * To ensure the DocArray children can be uniquely
